    <h2>study finds llamas smarter than people leaving researchers in awe</h2>
    <p>A new study released Tuesday by the Global Cognition Institute has confirmed what llamas have allegedly known for years: they are, by every measurable standard, smarter than humans. Researchers say llamas outperformed humans in problem-solving, cooperation, and emotional intelligence tests areas where humans “got distracted, panicked, or started forming subcommittees about whose fault it was.” “Llamas demonstrated self-control, fairness, and the ability to share,” said lead scientist Dr. Marjorie Penn. “Humans demonstrated Wi-Fi complaints and mild hostility.” In one experiment, llamas were able to remember food locations over 48 hours, while most human participants “needed Google Maps, coffee, and a three-day extension.” Following the report, humans took to social media to insist the study was “biased,” while llamas quietly formed a roundtable to discuss global water conservation. “Let’s not overreact,” said government spokesperson Alfred Llamason, blinking rapidly. “Humans are still the dominant species. The llamas are just… gifted. Excuse me, I need to go stand in a field and think for a while.” At press time, several llamas were seen staring at the horizon, appearing deep in thought possibly about the future of the planet, or whether humans were ever really trying. -not a llama
