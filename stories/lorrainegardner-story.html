    <h2>Local teacher discovers secret to student motivation</h2>
    <p>After centuries of teachers trying to get their students motivated without success, an instructor at a local community college has stumbled upon the long-awaited but always elusive holy grail. What is this incredible discovery? Sun Chips! 
        That's right--none other than the delightfully crispy snack that comes in four delectable varieties. How did this instructor make the discovery? She brought some individual bags of Sun Chips as a breaktime treat for her students before 
        they took their exam. One student said, "We will take a test every day if you bring us Sun Chips!" So there you have it: teachers have the power to stop whining and complaining on test day.</p>
