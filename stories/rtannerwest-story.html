            <h2>Local Tricker Treaters Rioting due to Half-Sized Candy Bars</h2>
            <p>
                Local tricker treaters are upset by the neighborhood's collective decision to switch from full-sized candy bars down to half-sized candy bars in an attempt to save money to save local library. So far at least 3 attempts to egg the library, 5 attempts to tp the mayor's house, and at least one alledged attempt to spraypaint the beloved statue of Sparky the Dog have been stopped by the very tired local police.
